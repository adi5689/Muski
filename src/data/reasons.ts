  export const loveLetter = `My Love,

  Happy Birthday to the girl who has grown another year older today, yet somehow still lives inside my heart like a five-year-old kiddo—curious, stubborn, innocent, dramatic, and impossibly adorable. Time may add candles to your cake, but it never touches the way you smile, the way you sulk, or the way you turn the simplest moments into memories I want to keep forever.
  
  We have been through our share of ups and downs. There were days when things felt easy and days when they felt unbearably heavy. Moments when words failed us, when silence spoke louder, when we questioned, hurt, misunderstood, and still—somehow—never truly walked away. No matter how far the argument took us, we always found our way back to each other. That’s what makes us us. Not perfection, but persistence. Not absence of pain, but the choice to stay.
  
  I celebrate you—not just today, but always. I celebrate your laughter that heals me without trying, your childish excitement over the smallest things, your strength that you often don’t see in yourself, and even your flaws that have quietly become my favorite parts. Loving you has taught me patience, softness, courage, and what it means to choose the same person again and again.
  
  I know there may be times when you feel that I’ve lost interest, or that I don’t value you the way I should. Please know this—my silence is never indifference, and my calm is never distance. Because the truth is this:
  
  I would drink poison if your lips were the cup, just to say that my last sweetness was you.
  
  Happy Birthday Baccha.
  Stay exactly who you are.
  I’ll keep finding my way back to you—always.
  
  
  Love, Kittu❤️`;
